# Advent of Code 2020

This repository holds my solutions for [AoC 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020). I've chosen Python as my language as it's pretty widespread and it's a good way to gain more practice.

## Prerequisites

[Python 3](https://python.org)

## Run solutions

Run tests:

```
$ python -m unittest
```
